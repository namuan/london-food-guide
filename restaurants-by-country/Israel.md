# Israeli Restaurants in London

## Coal Office
**Location:** Near King's Cross

**Comments:**
- "Israeli food. If you want a fancy twist on our cuisine, you must go to Coal Office near King's Cross. Assaf Granit (the chef) is basically the Israeli Gordon Ramsay."
- "Second Mazal. Coal office is on my list but I've heard it's gone downhill and no longer owned/managed by Granits people?"
- "Are you talking about Coal Office?"

## Mazal
**Location:** Camden

**Comments:**
- "If you want more common, cheaper, and authentic experience, go to Mazal in Camden."
- "Second Mazal. Coal office is on my list but I've heard it's gone downhill"
- "For casual 'greasy spoon' Israeli, Mazal in Camden is fantastic. Bills itself as an Industrial zone workers joint, and I'd agree. Best shawarma seasoning, and their Msabacha isn't bad."
- "Mazal is better. Pita is alright though, it's not bad"
- "https://www.mazal.london its so so good, genuinely best shawarma ive had outside of tel aviv :))"

## Bala Baya

**Comments:**
- "Bala Baya in Union Street at least bills itself as modern Israeli. It's spendy but very good, though I haven't been in a hot minute."

## Pockets
**Location:** East London

**Comments:**
