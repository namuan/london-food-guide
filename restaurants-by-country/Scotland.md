# Scottish Restaurants in London

## The Shoap
**Location:** Islington

**Comments:**
- "It's not non-UK, but The Shoap in Islington does proper Scottish scran. It's surprisingly difficult to get good quality versions of Scottish favourites in London, but they do good haggis, Stornoway black pudding, well fired rolls, scotch pies, tattie scones, etc."
- "Macaroni pies? Yep"
- "Do they do a soft morning roll, not a well fired one? that's the thing i miss most" "I remember they do both! I found their rolls quite dry though"
- "stop telling people about this place it always sells out ALL THE TIME :<"
