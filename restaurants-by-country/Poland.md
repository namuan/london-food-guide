# Polish Restaurants in London

## Ognisko
**Location:** South Kensington area

**Comments:**
- "Ognisko if you want a more high end Polish cuisine."
- "I'm not Polish but a date took me to Ognisko once. Food was amazing, and as the war in Ukraine had just started they had a cocktail called The Zelenskyy on the menu."
- "Yes to Ognishko!"
- "None polish here, I've been to Ognisko and it's a delight!"

## Daquise
**Location:** South Kensington (by underground station)

**Comments:**
- "Just down the road from Ognisko is Daquise (by South Ken underground station) which is arguably more genuinely Polish in terms of cuisine, but surroundings not as good as the outdoor terrace at Ognisko."
- "Both are great, but I read with great sadness that Daquise is due to close permanently soon to make way for the redevelopment of South Kensington tube station."
- "Apparently there isn't the money in place for the South Kensington tube development yet. So they're going to be there at least another year, maybe 3!"

## Mamuśka
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "I liked Mamuśka when it first opened some 15 years ago - it was more authentic and now I think it's become commercialised/westernised. Most of the food is still ok but they don't even have soups now, which wtf."

## Folkhouse Zakopane
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "It's closing in July I think because he's moving back, but Folkhouse Zakopane has always been our go to for like over half a decade"

## Retro
**Location:** Crystal Palace

**Comments:**
- "Retro in Crystal Palace is a nice, no-frills spot!"
- "I checked the menu online and they charge £16 for 5 pierogi, ouch!"
