# Hong Kong / Chinese Restaurants in London

## Dim Sum Duck
**Location:** Near King's Cross

**Comments:**
- "As a hongkonger, dim sum duck near king cross is a freaking godsend! It's getting too popular now and the queue is long so I don't go there a lot"
- "I agree! By far the best. Always such a treat"
- "I think the issue is some dishes are at a much higher level than others. Best duck, but the crispy roast pig was not good – almost tasted like it had gone bad."
- "I find their dimsum menu with limiting choices. For that reason alone not HK enough."
- "However when they first become so popular , the attitude of some of the staff definitely reminds me of the service levels in HK (at its peak). Also, the inconsistency of the quality of their dim sum IS quite a HK thing in itself"
- "They're opening a new one round the corner"

## Golden Dragon
**Location:** Chinatown

**Comments:**
- "My boyfriend is from Hong Kong and he said Golden Dragon in Chinatown is the only place that reminds him of home"

## Cantonese Restaurant (Forest Hill)
**Location:** Forest Hill

**Comments:**
- "Best ever Cantonese restaurant in Forest Hill that also specializes in Sichuan cuisine. Their food is really authentic, very different from other generic Chinese restaurant/takeaways. Their fried rice dishes are on a whole other level too plus alot of their dishes are made from scratch down to the sauces, dumplings and condiments."
- "I've been there on multiple occasions! Really affordable as well."

## Mandarin Kitchen, Bright Courtyard, Four Seasons, YiBan
**Location:** Various (YiBan near Excel)

**Comments:**
- "Chinese here... there's sadly not as many great place in London these days. A lot outside London though. But for in London, I'd say probably Mandarin Kitchen, Bright Courtyard, Four Seasons and YiBan near Excel."
