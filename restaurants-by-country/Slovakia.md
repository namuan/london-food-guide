**Comments:**
- "Slovakia - afaik we only have one, Bohemia House (Czechoslovak). It is really good though, I go every once in a while and my British friends like it too. If you go, I recommend the confit duck and Kofola on tap (and Becherovka if you want something stronger)"
- "There used to be a restaurant off Regent Street, as my mum was the cook there, but she also worked at the Czechoslovak Club (Bohemia House nowadays). So, I am VERY lucky because it means the food there was as good as my mum made!"
- "They also have it in Dukla shop in Golders green, but tap is better :)"
- "As a Brit, I can confirm thay Bohemia House is fantastic for non-Slovakians as well. Great food, great beer and wonderful service."
