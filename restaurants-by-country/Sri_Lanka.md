## Gaana

**Comments:**
- "In terms of Sri Lankan food, would recommend Machan's Kitchen in Clerkenwell. Food is top for a very reasonable price. Honourable mentions to Hopppers and Kolamba too in Central London. Further afield, Gaana in Rayners Lane has had a bit of a renaissance recently if you like Sri Lankan Tamil cuisine"
