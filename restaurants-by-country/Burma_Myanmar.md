**Comments:**
- "Not me but my mum, took her to Lahpet for tea leaf salad and she nearly cried. This was when they had their first place in London Fields"

- "My Mrs is Burmese, says lahpet is weak, she refuses to go again so I can try 😂"
- "Sadly like most other things the quality has gone down ... I took my parents to their London bridge branch last summer and it was ok - not amazing. The fish was banging though"
