# Turkish Restaurants in London

## The Counter
**Location:** Multiple locations (town location mentioned)

**Comments:**
- "Turkish here: The Counter. Definitely not your typical kebab restaurant, but more of a modern take on turkish cuisine. They just opened a new location in town as well"

## Yeni
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "My favourite Turkish place is Yeni. It's not Turkish traditional, not exactly fusion. But they definitely took and improved a lot of stuff."

## Kilis
**Location:** Islington

**Comments:**
- "For Turkish traditional kebab-style food I'd go with Kilis Islington."

## Original Turkish Eatery
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "Unfortunately I don't know ANY spots that do Turkish traditional home-cooked food. There's Original Turkish Eatery. While their choice of dishes is quite nice, the taste leaves a lot to be desired. Bland at best."

## Enfes Ocakbasi
**Location:** Haringey

**Comments:**
- "Sadly you won't find 10/10 Turkish food in London but I've tried a lot of restaurants and the one closest to home is Enfes Ocakbasi in Haringey. Their Adana kebab is as close to being authentic as it can get"
