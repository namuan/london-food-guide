# Philippine Restaurants in London

## Lutong Pinoy Kamayan
**Location:** Earl's Court

**Comments:**
- "Philippines - I have tried the authentic ones: Inihaw- Charlton, Greenwich. legit authentic filipino. I often ordered takeaway there when I was pregnant. I love the lechon kawali and pork Bbq."
- "Lutong Pinoy Kamayan: both of these in Earl's court. I know there's a jollibee nearby but that is fastfood and these are restaurants with more filipino meals."
- "Lutong Pinoy for me"
