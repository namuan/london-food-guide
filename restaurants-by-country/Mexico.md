## Mestizo
**Location:** Hampstead Rd

**Comments:**
- "Mestizo (Hampstead Rd) for Mexican and there's a shop for ingredients across the street."

## Archie's
**Location:** 319 Railton Rd, London SE24 0JN

**Comments:**
- "(American, Deep South) And while not strictly My Heritage (but it is a couson of mine's so I've had a lot of it lol), Archie's has the closest I've thusfar had to Mexican/Latin American food. It's obviously presented in a way that's appealing to middle class londoners, but i was surprised at how comparable it was to American-Mexican."
