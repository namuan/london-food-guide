## Kolapata
**Location:** Opposite The Blind Beggar pub

**Comments:**
- "🇧🇩 East Bengal / Bangladesh 🇧🇩 Opposite The Blind Beggar pub, you'll find Kolapata (translation: Banana Leaf), an old school place I've been going to since I was a kid to enjoy the delicacies of Dacca (Dhaka). So much has changed in that area it but it stands as my rock. Start with a cup of chaa (chai/tea) and let the vibes take you to places."
