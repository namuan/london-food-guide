# Iranian Restaurants in London

## Mohsen
**Location:** Not specified (around Kensington area)

**Comments:**
- "Best Iranian restaurant in London in my opinion."
- "I've tried most of the Iranian restaurants around Kensington, Marylebone, central London, Ealing, north & south London. MY favourite is Mohsen by a long way. The quality has been consistently outstanding over the 25 years I've been going."
- "Mohsen does but they call it Abgoosht. I think most do."
- "Hafez was the first iranian restaurant I tried. It's also very good but I prefer Mohsen."
- "Love this one!"
- "Best Iranian by a country mile."
- "They're all good! But my fav is kabab. 'Makhsoos' (translation is special) barg and kobede. Love the bread and salad Olivia. I've also had the gormeh sabsi, khoreshe ghame and don't forget faloode!"

## Mahdi's
**Location:** Hammersmith

**Comments:**
- "Have you tried Mahdi's in Hammersmith? Pricier than it used to be but great food."
- "Mahdis was amazing, haven't been in a few years but i do also remember thinking that if youre claustrophobic you'd have a hard time in there because they absolutely stuffed the building with as many tables as they possibly could."

## Crystal
**Location:** Croydon

**Comments:**
- "I think Mohsen is far better. Also if you're in croydon. Crystal is the best south of London."
- "Crystal is very good, the koobideh is amazing - never had a better kebab anywhere, I even took some home"
- "Crystal is the bomb I used to live 5 min from there. I honestly was surprised how good it is I wasn't expecting that level of quality Iranian food in Croydon lol"

## Colbeh
**Location:** Not specified (Kensington area)

**Comments:**
- "A family favourite of ours is Colbeh."
- "I'd also plug https://www.colbeh.co.uk/"
- "I've been eating here for the last 20 years. Their homemade bread from the clay oven and hummus is unreal."

## Kishmish
**Location:** Crystal Palace

**Comments:**
- "Have you been to Kishmish in Crystal Palace and, if so, what did you think? I really like it."
- "Funny name. Means raisin. Will try it!"
- "Just checked out their website. This is bad news. I doubt the food will be great. 'Kish Mish Restaurant which is one of the very few Mediterranean Persian infused Restaurant'. 🙄"

## Hafez
**Location:** Bayswater

**Comments:**
- "Have you tried Hafez in Bayswater? Will definitely check this out!"
- "Hafez was the first iranian restaurant I tried. It's also very good but I prefer Mohsen."

## Berenjak
**Location:** Not specified (Kensington area mentioned)

**Comments:**
- "Oooo thanks for the rec. really don't like berenjak and was worried that was gonna be listed."
- "not to be biased but a lot of the good iranian restaurants in london are around the kensington area 🙂‍↕️ non-iranians, steer clear of berenjak!"
- "Wait as an Iranian I love, love Berenjak. It's obviously not classic Persian fare but the spin they have on it is still delicious."
- "the pricing is the big issue for me - £19 for 2 skewers of joojeh (rice is an extra £4 if you want it!) when i could pay around the same or less for more food in other iranian restaurants"
