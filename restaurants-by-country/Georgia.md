# Georgian Restaurants in London

## Shoty
**Location:** South Kensington

**Comments:**
- "Wondering if any Georgians can chip in, as I tried Shoty (South Kensington) last year which was good, but with no Georgians in the group, we weren't sure of the best way of ordering, so I got some very odd dumplings and soup."

## Aba Ra
**Location:** Brick Lane

**Comments:**
- "I'm not Georgian but my friend from Azerbaijan told me about Aba Ra on brick Lane and apparently it's authentic. It was pretty great. Really good khachapuri, wine and puddings"

## Little Georgia

**Comments:**
- "I am not Georgian but a couple of times I've enjoyed Little Georgia in Islington"
