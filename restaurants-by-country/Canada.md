# Canadian Restaurants in London

## The Maple Leaf
**Location:** Covent Garden

**Comments:**
- "Well there's one and it's shit. Technically the best because it's the only one but definitely also the worst. The Maple Leaf in Covent Garden."
- "Once the poutine guy stop serving a few of us made an outing there because someone wanted to try poutine. It was very meh, and the place was full of mice to an extreme degree"
- "I miss wing nights. :("
- "They'll have Ontario beers and hockey games if that's your jam and other than that it's basic British pub fare. :("
- "I remember taking my Canadian friends there 34 years ago…Labatts and Molsen Golden were the draws back then."
- "Canadian here.. I guess I'd have to say The Maple Leaf in Covent Garden as that's the only place I know of. Their poutine has gotten better since I first moved here."

## Gerry's Hot Sub Deli
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "Apparently, the poutine here is good and it's highly rated by Jay Rayner"
- "I love this place. Subs are amazing too."
- "Can confirm it's the closest to the Poutine I had in Montreal"
- "Sadly Gerry's poutine doesn't hit the mark for me, it's got a sweet almost sickly taste to it."
- "Agree - Gerry's poutine is bang average, disappointingly unauthentic."

## Poutinie
