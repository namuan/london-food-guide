# Danish Restaurants in London

## Ole & Steen
**Location:** Multiple locations

**Comments:**
- "Denmark here - No real Danish restaurants (which is fine), but I can vouch for the pastries at Ole & Steen - they are exactly as they should be."
- "They're pretty close but not quite as good as Lagkagehuset [1] or another good baker usually is in Copenhagen. The pastries aren't exactly as crisp. Good effort, though."
- "Omg I never realised it was the same as lagkagehuset! Thank you for that" (Note: It's the same people, they just use a different name in Denmark vs abroad)

## Skandi Kitchen
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "Skandi Kitchen has some decent pan-Scandi food, but more Swedish than Danish."
- "Nothing actually wrong with Scandi Kitchen's actual Danish stuff, but it's all frozen for transport (even the rugbrød) which makes it not quite as good as going to the supermarket in Denmark."
