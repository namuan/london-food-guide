# Portuguese Restaurants in London

## O Tino
**Location:** Camden Town

**Comments:**
- "O Tino in Camden Town for portuguese food! There's A La Carte menu but then at the weekends there's a dish of the day, different every day!"
- "Tino is ok."

## A Toca
**Location:** Vauxhall

**Comments:**
- "A Toca is definitely my reccomendations for staple Portuguese food"
- "A toca in Vauxhall is heaven!"
- "So happy to finally find portuguese recommendation!!! 100% toca for the best portuguese in london! Nice people and amazing food!"
- "A Toca might be the best for a relatively diverse Portuguese menu in London, but it is unfortunately nowhere near the quality of Portuguese restaurants in Portugal."

## Barros
**Location:** Stockwell

**Comments:**
- "For portuguese food, I've only ever been to Barros in Stockwell, but I really liked it. Prices aren't quite the same as back home (as any place in London), but portion sizes and the dishes were great."

## Casa do Frango
**Location:** Not specified

**Comments:**
- "The best Portuguese restaurant in London I know is Casa do Frango, but that one is very limited in terms of menu (mostly chicken)."

## Douro
**Location:** Liverpool Street and London Bridge

**Comments:**
- "Tino and A Toca like people already mentioned used to be my go to places (Tino to order from, A Toca for gatherings). Lately I really like going to Douro, though. Less quantity and a bit pricey (specially the wines) but more refined and a calmer atmosphere"

## Portuguese Love Affair
**Location:** Hackney Road

**Comments:**
- "Portuguese Love Affair in Hackney Road"
- "Nooo they had wines sorted by white, red and verde!"
