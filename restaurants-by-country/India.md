# Indian Restaurants in London

## Tamil Prince
**Location:** Islington

**Comments:**
- "Indian: I just love Tamil Prince so much. Their flavours are on point and they do the best Bloody Mary in the city. Their dal and chhole bhature are amazing and their robata grill marinades hit the spot."
- "Love Tamil Prince but some of its prices are not defensible. £37.50 for 3 small lamb chops (which are great but cmon) is robbery."

## Dishoom
**Location:** Multiple locations

**Comments:**
- "As a Mumbaikar, the Dishoom Vada pav is legit. As is their chilli cheese toast and malwani prawn fry."
- "Dishoom is excellent, even though it gets a lot of hate here"
- "Yeah, I don't care for their ruby murray or wtv but they do the basics of Bombay food decently enough. I see comments like 'it's not really Indian food' which make me laugh; a lot of Dishoom's menu is clearly a take on an Irani cafe, which is a Bombay staple."
- "The kheema pav at Dishoom is legit better than most Iranian cafes in Mumbai."
- "There's always going to be a chunk of people who think it makes them look discerning to hate anything that's popular or has more than one location"

## Shree Sai Vada Pav
**Location:** Rayners Lane and Ilford

**Comments:**
- "I think there are better places for vada pav but Dishoom isn't bad at all. For vada pav - shree sai vada pav in Rayners Lane"
